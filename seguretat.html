  <!-- DEFINITION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>What is computer security?</h2>
    <p>
      Computer security is the set of controls and measures that protects computers, networks and data
      from unauthorized access, theft, misuse or damage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It usually focuses on three main goals: confidentiality (only authorised people can access data),
      integrity (data cannot be changed without control) and availability (systems are working when needed). 
    </p>

  <!-- COMPONENTS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Security components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical security</strong>: protecting hardware (PCs, servers, routers) from theft, damage or tampering. </li>
      <li><strong>Network security</strong>: firewalls, VPNs and other mechanisms to control traffic between internal and external networks. ]</li>
      <li><strong>Software and data security</strong>: antivirus, updates, backups and data encryption. </li>
      <li><strong>Policies and procedures</strong>: strong passwords, user roles, access policies and user awareness training. </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- PRACTICAL MEASURES -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Basic security measures</h2>
    <p>Some simple measures that can be applied on any computer or small network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the operating system and applications updated to fix vulnerabilities. </li>
      <li>Install antivirus and anti‑malware software and keep them up to date. </li>
      <li>Enable and correctly configure the firewall. </li>
      <li>Make regular backups of important data. </li>
      <li>Use strong passwords and, when possible, multi‑factor authentication. ]</li>
      <li>Protect equipment physically (locks, labels, restricted areas). </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- EXAMPLE FOR THE PROJECT -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Example for the project</h2>
    <p>
      For the exemplification part, you can create a small security checklist for one lab PC:
      check updates, active antivirus, firewall configuration, strong user password and basic physical protection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add screenshots of the firewall or antivirus configuration and explain them in a few short sentences.
