    <h2>What is an Operating System (OS)?</h2>
    <p>
      An operating system is a collection of software that interfaces between the human user and the hardware. 
      It is the first software installed on a hard disk and the first to be loaded into memory when the computer is turned on.

    <h2>The 5 Critical Tasks (The Conductor)</h2>
    <p>The OS acts like an orchestra conductor, managing five essential functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>System Management:</strong> Managing the start-up (booting) and resources.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Managing connections to the Internet and email.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Including utilities to keep viruses out and manage user authentication.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Services:</strong> Controlling peripheral devices (printers, monitors, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Software Services:</strong> Installing and managing applications (apps).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Categories and History</h2>
    <p>Operating systems have evolved significantly since the 1950s:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Desktop OS:</strong> Microsoft Windows (started with MS-DOS), Mac OS X (for Apple computers), and Linux.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile OS:</strong> Designed for smartphones and tablets, with Android and iOS as the current leaders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The OS Role in Security</h2>
    <p>The OS is the bedrock of computer security, maintaining three main pillars:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Protecting data from unauthorized changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring systems work when needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Managing user identity and encryption.</li>
    </ol>
